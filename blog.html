   Mobley, Kelly, Chambers, and Cobb all left Davis by the end of 1962, and during 1963 he struggled to maintain a steady line-up. By the late spring, he had hired the core of the Second Quintet with Herbie Hancock on piano, Ron Carter on bass, and Tony Williams on drums.[9] Initially with George Coleman or Sam Rivers on tenor sax, the final member of the quintet arrived in late 1964 when saxophonist Wayne Shorter joined.

The performance style of the Second Great Quintet was often referred to by Davis as "time, no changes", incorporating elements of free jazz without completely surrendering to the approach. This allowed the five musicians to simultaneously contribute to the group as equals at times, rather than to always follow the established pattern of having the group leader and then the backing musicians perform unrelated solos.[10] This band recorded the albums E.S.P., Miles Smiles, Sorcerer, Nefertiti, Miles in the Sky, and Filles de Kilimanjaro, and the live set considered by The Penguin Guide to Jazz to be their crowning achievement, The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel 1965.

When Davis began to become more interested in the rock, soul, and funk music of the late 1960s, the Second Quintet unraveled. Carter departed during the sessions for Filles de Kilimanjaro, and Williams left in early 1969 to start his own band, the Tony Williams Lifetime, staying on with Davis to record the groundbreaking In a Silent Way.[11] Davis would continue his innovations into jazz fusion with the album Bitches Brew and his work in the 1970s. As a result, the Second Quintet came to an end, though Hancock would contribute to subsequent sessions with Miles and appear on Jack Johnson, On the Corner, and Get Up with It. Players on In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew would go on to form the core jazz fusion bands of the 1970s away from Davis: Shorter and Josef Zawinul to Weather Report; John McLaughlin and Billy Cobham to the Mahavishnu Orchestra; Hancock and Bennie Maupin to Headhunters; and Chick Corea, Airto Moreira and Lenny White to Return to Forever.

Columbia/Legacy Recordings released Freedom Jazz Dance: The Bootleg Series Vol. 5, a collection of previously unreleased tracks recorded by the Second Great Quintet between 1966 and 1968.[12]

from the introduction:
generally she thought that uh. capitalsim needed to continue to expand into new markets in order to survive
but she was wrong - 
introduction note 66

"the reform as a means of revolution"

credit helps creates crises in two ways, from the side of production and from the side of consumption. The first way, it extends the productive capacity of industry and so speeds up the crisis of overproduction-- "an inner motive forcce that is contrantly pushing production to exceed the limits of the market"

second way, from the consumption side, during an econmic crisis credit melts away, also effectively shrinking the market and speeding up effect of overproduction



- the proliferation of credit
- the proliferation of trusts/cartels

there are things that seem like capitalism adapting to its contradictions



---


we don't need refutations of his point but rather an explanation of how he used the term in an unconventional, pointed way that contributes to our understanding of the civil war and slavery in general

his ideas are consistent with understanding of the mass strike, that don't necessitate being completely planned out in advance, top-down

p120 the mass strike





using "anarchy" to describe capitalism


the expression of mass strike
the expression of the proletariat becomeing a group

it's not so that the planned, coordinateed mass strike would preempt

the revolution
or would show it's not necessaary or that it's already been acheived

it's that the mass strike is the beginning of the revolution

p142



> Every great political mass action, after it has attained its political highest point, breaks up into a mass of economic strikes. And that applies not only to each of the great mass strikes, but also to the revolution as a whole"

why

> The tacit assumption is that the entire working class of Germany, down to the last man and the last woman, must be included in the organization before it "is strong enough" to risk a mass action, which then, according to the old formula, would probably be represented as "superfluous." This theory is nevertheless absolutely utopian, for the simple reason that it suffers from an internal contradiction that goes in a vicious circle. Before the workers can engage in any class struggle they must all be organized. The circumstances, the conditions, of capitalist development and of the bourgeois state make it impossible that, in the normal course of things, without stormy class struggles, certain sections and these the greatest, the most important, the lowest and the most oppressed by capital, and by the state-can be organized at all. 



so what is the way? if it's not what the anarchists say either?

the answer is, an organization, but it's not that an organization provides the numbers and discipline to do the struggle but the struggle that provides people for the organization...



the introduction mentioned that what she's saying appears to be in contrast with Lenin says, but they actually agreed generally
